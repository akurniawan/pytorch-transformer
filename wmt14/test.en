A Republic@@ an strategy to counter the re-@@ election of Obama
Republic@@ an leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is rar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by ligh@@ tn@@ ing .
Indeed , Republic@@ an lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vot@@ er tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republic@@ an representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 b@@ ills restric@@ ting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
Furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invali@@ date the right to register as a vot@@ er on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indi@@ ana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States uph@@ eld the constitu@@ tionality of the Indi@@ ana law .
The Republic@@ an authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they sponsor@@ ed b@@ ills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
It is important to note that , unlike Qu@@ eb@@ ec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
The new restrictions dis@@ proportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
And that &apos;s not all .
Stu@@ dents , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
On the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republic@@ an , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
Pri@@ or to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a do@@ zen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ pan@@ ic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three His@@ pan@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 2011 Republic@@ an legislat@@ ors sponsor@@ ed laws abo@@ lish@@ ing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
These restrictions are not without consequence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , vot@@ er registration campaigns contributed to regi@@ stering around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republic@@ an legislat@@ ors have en@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans , who accoun@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
On the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic legislat@@ ors and their supporters vigor@@ ously opposed the adoption of laws restric@@ ting vot@@ er registration .
Several b@@ ills were blocked by v@@ et@@ oes of Democratic govern@@ ors .
The United States Att@@ or@@ ney General interven@@ ed to suspend the most controversial laws .
They were able to partially limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
However , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic critics den@@ ounce the parti@@ san character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
A 2011 Brenn@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant imp@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Pro@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
Indeed , the PS@@ A test sometimes shows er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
En@@ ough to make already reluc@@ tant men hesitate to take screening tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two specialists for their opinion .
In studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mort@@ ality between patients who were scre@@ ened and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a follow-up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for met@@ ast@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state cancer .
Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American men are also more at risk .
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
There are aggressive canc@@ ers and others that are ind@@ ol@@ ent .
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating pro@@ state canc@@ ers that are not long-term life threatening , and op@@ ting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
Active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
Therefore I recommend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In collaboration with the Soci@@ été internationale d &apos;@@ ur@@ ologie &#91; SI@@ U &#93; , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pro@@ s and cons of the PS@@ A test .

Pre@@ v@@ enting the disease
Unfortunately , there is no mi@@ racle recip@@ e for preventing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living hab@@ its remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exerc@@ ised enough , 30 % of canc@@ ers could be prevented .
&quot; If no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , &quot; says Andr@@ é Beau@@ li@@ eu , spo@@ kes@@ man for the Canadian Canc@@ er Society .
On the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of canc@@ ers are her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary .
Some are also completely un@@ explained .
For the Canadian Canc@@ er Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ kers .
C@@ igar@@ ettes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This massi@@ vely damages people &apos;s health .
&quot; Even today , there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Qu@@ eb@@ ec &quot; depl@@ ores spo@@ kes@@ person Andr@@ é Beau@@ li@@ eu .
En@@ cour@@ aging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer dro@@ ps by half .

Over@@ weight and o@@ bes@@ ity are also con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the on@@ set of the disease , according to the SC@@ C .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ tum , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ g@@ us , pan@@ cre@@ as and uter@@ us .
&quot; Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer &quot; it is also said .
Di@@ et
The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing col@@ o-@@ rec@@ tal cancer .
Likewise , so do cur@@ ed meat products , and these should be avoided .
The conservation of meat by smoking , dr@@ ying or cur@@ ing can cause the formation of car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens .
&quot; They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer &quot; it is explained .
Vit@@ am@@ ins
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vit@@ amin suppl@@ ements and cancer .
For the time being however their research is in@@ conclu@@ sive .
Studies on vit@@ amin E are contradic@@ tory , according to the SC@@ C .
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer , another noted an increase .
